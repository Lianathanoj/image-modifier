        <h3 class="center">Abstract</h3>
        <p>The goal of the project is to process an image to be more pleasing to the eye according to the rule of thirds—a photographical rule of thumb. This will be able to help photographers, especially amateur ones, improve their skills by giving them a general reference for how an image could be aesthetically improved. For the mid-term update, we used Mask R-CNN for feature extraction and seam carving in order to shift the most strongly identified human onto one of the gridlines (see the Introduction section for more details on the Rule of Thirds). We plan on polling people to compare this result to the original image to see how preferable the result is.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The rule of thirds is an image metric and well-known guideline used by photographers to increase the overall aesthetic of a composition, wherein an image is overlaid onto a 3 x 3 grid and the subject matter becomes more qualitatively agreeable if it falls within the middle intersections of the grid (see images below). While there do exist applications such as Photoshop which require some manual input on the user end to crop images to fit this rule, we wanted to create something that would implement this rule in different ways on existing photos so that the photos would, in theory, be more aesthetically pleasing and then see how these results compare to the originals. This method would also be more automatic compared to tools such as Photoshop which require incremental cropping by the user.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Technical Approach</h3>
        <p>Our technical approach was subdivided into multiple steps. First, we utilized a Mask R-CNN which has been pre-trained upon a large set of images. We then were able to extract an image's important areas of interest which later allowed us to transform the image to adhere to the rule of thirds using seam carving techniques. The code for this approach can be found <a href=https://github.com/Lianathanoj/image-modifier>here.</a></p>
      </div>
      
      <h5>1) Determining Bounding Box and Masks of Points of Interest Via Feature Extraction</h5>
      <div style="margin-left:50px;">
        <p><b>a) </b>Using a Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) applied from <a href=https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN>this repository</a>, we extracted areas of interest in the format of bounding boxes and semantic segmentation masks for multiple different categories, including people, dogs, cats, and cars. Each different object found within an image had its own box or mask returned as well as its own resulting image where it is on a thirds line. Note that we are using pre-trained weights for Mask R-CNN because the classifier was sufficiently able to detect different classes well. Furthermore, rather than having a long and expensive training process which could potentially produce a suboptimal end classifier, we focused more time on the applications of Mask-RCNN. Our decision was made after we tested self-retrieved pictures to make sure that humans were being correctly detected and ensured that our bounding box correctly encapsulated human outlines.</p>
        <p><b>b) </b>Dilation was then added to the outputed masks because the mask did not always cover the whole object being detected. Therefore expanding the mask was a safe option to ensure that the object will not be affected by the seam carvings.</p>
      </div>

      <h5>2) Seam Carving Techniques</h5>
      <div style="margin-left:50px;">
          <p><b>a) </b>First, we select all of the objects that we decide were relevant to the image such as humans, dogs, apple, etc. For each object we create a new image where the rule of thirds is applied to each object.</p>
          <p><b>b) </b>We then determine the midpoint of the bounding box, which is our specific interest point. We apply rules to how the object should be moved to reach the new position for the rule of thirds. The general idea is to move the object to the closest line (rule of thirds).</p>
          <p><b>c) </b>Finally, we calculate which line the midpoint is closest to: one of the gridlines or the edges of the picture (the labelled vertical lines in figure below). If the midpoint is closest to one of the edge lines (A or D), then we generate seams on the side of the edge closest to midpoint (on the left and right respectively). If the midpoint is closest to B or C, we carve seams from the other side of the image to shift the midpoint instead. By having both the same number of seam deletions and generations, we are able to approximately retain the original image aspect ratio.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Experiment and Results</h3>
        <p>Used pre-trained COCO weights for Mask R-CNN. The pre-trained COCO weights were trained on the <a href=http://cocodataset.org/>Coco dataset</a> which contains 330,000 images and 1.5 million object instances. The results of Mask R-CNN with the COCO pre-trained weights detected the correct objects very well for multiple types of images and scenery, but some of mask boundaries are slightly off, as seen by the figures below.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Qualitative Results</h3>
        <h5>1) Human Success Cases</h5>
        <div style="margin-left:50px;">
          <p><b>a) </b>In the two figures below, the subject is located in the middle between the two vertical rule-of-thirds lines. She is closer to the right side, so we will want to align her along that line. To do so, our seam carving algorithm removed seams from the right of the subject to move the vertical rule-of-thirds line to the left. Our algorithm also applies the red dot in the original picture to denote the center of the object of interest. The background of the picture has no significant objects/features so our seam removal has little negative consequences on the aesthetic of the picture.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/outdoor_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>b) </b>For the next two figures below, the original picture is already quite close to placing the subject along the second-third line; she is a little too far to the right of it when using the rule of thirds line as the base point. For this image, our algorithm removes vertical seams from the left of the subject.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/railroad_girl_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>c) </b>In the next two figures below, the subject in this image is in the center, but he is closer to the left rule-of-thirds line. To align the two, we remove seams to the left of the person.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/lake_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>d) </b>In the next two figures below, the subject is located far to the right in this picture, close to the right boundary of the image. Our algorithm does a series of seam additions to the right of the woman and seam removals to the left of the woman until she is aligned correctly onto the second rule-of-thirds line.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/beach_mod.png"></div>
        </div>

        <h5>2) Object/Animal Success Cases</h5>
        <div style="margin-left:50px;">
          <p><b>a) </b>In the original figure, the fire hydrant is located far to the right of the picture. Because of its location, we have done seam additions to the right of the object and seam removals to the left of it. The seam additions are not very noticeable but can be found by looking at the very slight discrepancy in the grass texture to the right of the fire hydrant in the modified image.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/fire_hydrant_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>b) </b>Based upon the red dot in the original image, the kitten's center is to the left of the second rule-of-thirds line. As a result, we moved the kitten's center to the right and had our algorithm emphasize seam removals more than seam additions for this case.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:250px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/cat_pounce_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>c) </b>Similar to the kitten figures above, the Tesla's center can be found close to the center of the picture, but ultimately it is closer to the second rule-of-thirds line than it is to the first rule-of-thirds line. As a result, the Tesla is moved rightwards with an emphasis on seam removals. While the car was successfully placed onto the second rule-of-thirds line, the seam removals are slightly noticeable because the yellow road lines are slightly malformed.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/car_tesla_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>d) </b>For these figures, the center of the car was detected to be closer to the second rule-of-thirds line. While the car was successfully moved to this line, the car in the original picture took up a larger proportion of the image, meaning that the trunk is slightly closer to the right of the modified image than desired. Our algorithm opted to do seam additions more to the left when more additions to the right would have been preferable. Still, we consider this a success case because the car was moved successfully, no noticeable artifacts occurred, and the car itself did not become malformed.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/car_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>e) </b>According to our algorithm, the center of the flowers is closer to the first rule-of-thirds line and was thus moved rightward. Because the floor and background's overall coloring scheme is relatively consistent, there are no noticeable artifacts despite having seam additions and removals.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/flower_mod.png"></div>

          <p><b>f) </b> Because of our bounding box calculations, the algorithm opted to place the center of the dog slightly to the left of its mouth because of the position of its hind legs. While a photographer might have more emphasized the dog's face when framing it for the rule of thirds, our algorithm placed the center of the dog's bounding box on the first rule-of-thirds line. The background is also slightly blurrier, meaning any artifacts that could have potentially shown up would blend in with the background despite our algorithm's changes. This means our algorithm for rule of thirds works especially well with other photographic elements such as having a different lense type or aperture setting with a more blurred background.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/dog_grass_mod.png"></div>
        </div>

        <h5>3) Multiple Human/Object/Animal Success Cases</h5>
        <div style="margin-left:50px;">
          <p><b>a) </b>For the first two figures below, our algorithm first selects the child as the person of interest and finds its bounding box. For the second two figures, our algorithm selects the teddy bear as the object of interest. Based upon the figures' respective centers, we are able to take into account multiple humans, animals, or objects and showcase different combinations of pictures which adhere to the rule of thirds.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/teddybear_mod1.png"></div>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/teddybear_mod2.png"></div>

          <p><b>b) </b>We find different combinations of pictures based upon the center of the dog and person. Even though their relative centers are close to each other, when the dog is selected as the object of interest, the modified image contains a malformed human as compared to when the human is selected as the object of interest. This means that our algorithm occasionally cannot fully account for multiple objects when they are in close proximity to each other, but that is ameliorated by the fact that different outputs are generated which can still contain stable outputs.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/human_dog_dock_mod1.png"></div>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:320px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/human_dog_dock_mod2.png"></div>

          <p><b>c) </b>For this case, while there are three distinct objects (dog, cat, and trunk),</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/dog_cat_trunk_mod1.png"></div>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/dog_cat_trunk_mod2.png"></div>

          <p><b>e) </b>cat dog</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:300px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/cat_dog_mod1.png"></div>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:300px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/cat_dog_mod2.png"></div>

          <p><b>f) </b>dog cat grass</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/dog_cat_grass_mod1.png"></div>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/dog_cat_grass_mod2.png"></div>
        </div>

        <h5>4) Failure Cases</h5>
         <div style="margin-left:50px;">
          <p><b>a) </b>The two figures below represent an example of a failure case for our algorithm. The subject is in the center of the image but closer to the vertical first third line. When our algorithm removes seams from the left of the person, the seam carving algorithm has no knowledge of the road in the background or the straight edges of the side of the road that should be maintained. Thus, the removals leave obvious artifacts.</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:350px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result5.png"></div>

          <p><b>b) </b>car people</p>
          <div class="center"><img style="height:250px; width:auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="assets/result_pics/car_people_mod1.png"></div>

        <h3 class="center">Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
          added non-human recognition, take into account multiple objects, optimized seam removals/additions (not as many obvious artifacts)


          <p>We decided to introduce rule of thirds more in the project update to elucidate what exactly it was and our motivation for creating this image modifier. In our proposal, we had a pre-processing step to smooth out the images, but in our project update, we decided to remove this section and rely on a pre-trained Mask R-CNN to take in images as inputs without needing the pre-processing steps. In our proposal, we originally divided up our experiment into different methods and planned to compare the outputs, but we realized that our methods were less discrete and were more suitable to be used as separate steps to the same process that we will work to refine. As a result, in this project update, we combined the steps to carry out the rule of thirds image modifier. Furthermore, we listed “homography transformation” as a way to do image modification in our proposal, but ultimately we solely used  the seam carving technique to remove pixels from the image.</p>

          <p>For now, we are only using bounding boxes, but in the future, we plan on utilizing Mask R-CNN’s segmentation mask within an energy function to better evaluate removing seams from the picture. We also plan to add code which takes into account multiple people (meaning we would need to change the code to decipher multiple bounding boxes and masks). We are also planning to extend our image modifier to work with a combination of objects and humans because we can utilize Mask R-CNN’s multiple classes to recognize different objects (e.g. cars, signs, animals, etc.). This way we can see if this method is more suitable for a certain type of image compared to others. Our seam deletion code could also use some future improvements because the current deletion code sometimes does not optimally delete seams to make a picture look as aesthetically pleasing as it should. We can also add post image processing techniques to make seam line additions transition between with the original image. We can try other techniques such as directly moving the object over into the correct position and using image completion models to fit in the areas left behind. Furthermore, we can add post processing techniques on the mask before altering the image such as adding dilation onto the mask to cover areas that were not originally masked, thereby allowing more room for error with the Mask R-CNN. Finally, we need to poll people to determine if the final outputs look better than the original images.</p>
