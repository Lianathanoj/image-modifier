        <h3 class="center">Abstract</h3>
        <p>The rule of thirds is an image metric used by photographers to increase the overall aesthetic of a composition, wherein an image is overlaid onto a 3 x 3 grid and the subject matter becomes more qualitatively agreeable if it falls within the middle intersections of the grid. </p>

        <h3 class="center">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The goal of the project is to thus process an image to be more pleasing to the eye according to the rule of thirds. The expected input is an image with a person or group of people, and the expected output is an image with points of interest repositioned to be at "pleasing" points according to the rule of thirds.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Technical Approach</h3>
        <p>Our technical approach can be subdivided into multiple steps. First, we will be utilizing a Mask R-CNN which has been pre-trained upon a large set of images. We will then be able to extract an image's important areas of interest which will allow us to later transform the image to adhere to the rule of thirds.</p>

      <h5>1) Determining Bounding Box and Masks of Points of Interest Via Feature Extraction</h5>
      Using a Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN, we extracted areas of interest such as the relevant bounding boxes and semantic segmentation masks for people that were at different points in a picture. Note that the Mask R-CNN already had a pre-trained classifier that we opted to use because it sufficiently was able to detect different classes. We tested self-retrieved pictures to make sure that humans were being correctly detected and to ensure that our bounding box correctly encapsulated human outlines.

      <h5>2) Seam Carving Techniques</h5>
      After we have outputted the picture and the relevant bounding boxes, we apply certain rules to remove or generate pixels based upon the location of the bounding boxes and use the mask to determine the energy of the image.

              <li>We will have people compare the outputs of each method for the same image sets, to see how well each method does</li>
              <li>Our population will be a sample of at least 50 people from the Georgia Tech student body</li>
              <li>The original set of images will comprise the control set</li>
              <li>The image method that generates the most pleasing output out of the three, according to our sample set would be the “best” method</li>
